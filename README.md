- Access: Dashboard with job management

**Candidate Account:**
- Username: `candidate`
- Password: `password`
- Access: Job listings and application form

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build production bundle
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Features

### Admin Features
- Create new job postings with job name, description, and salary range
